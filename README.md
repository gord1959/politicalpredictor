# politicalpredictor
a small program to analyze what is happening in the world. Get a briefing on events, a risk assessment and other things . the exe is located in bin/release/net6.0-windows. nothing to install. After running the program, choose the country, choose the briefing tone, then click "Analyze Risk". You can choose a different briefing tone and generate a different briefing at will. You can add a country not on the list and if you want it to stay on the list just click "Save Profiles". You can save the analysis as a txt file if you want. You can see a chart of all the countries on the list and thier instability percentages when you click the "View Instability Map" button. I put all the code there so if it doesn't work feel free to put it in visual studio and fix it so it does. It works fine on my pc.
